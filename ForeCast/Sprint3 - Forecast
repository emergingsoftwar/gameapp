The forecast for this sprint includes:
* Identify the correct API to fetch data from, populate the data nicely in tabular format inside the webpage, add buttons and implement their functionalities: 16 points
* Revise the header and navbar: 4 points
* Add export function to allow user getting his final friend list: 1 point
* Add more test cases: 1 point
* Finish adding some page's content and submit the sprint: 2 points

In this stage, we will work on fetching real data from open-source API, then populate and display them nicely on the website. We also will add more functions to 
allow users to interact with the data and be able to use the app for their purpose - making new friends for their gaming journey. Adding the export function will 
allow users to keep their final friend list on their computer. We will also add more test cases for testing new functions purpose.
