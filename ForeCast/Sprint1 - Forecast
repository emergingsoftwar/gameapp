The forecast for the first sprint includes:
* Pick a project management tool and create the board for the team to track and work on the project: 3 points
* Research and collect data: 2 points
* Select platform, create environment and code repository: 3 points
* Document and submit the sprint: 2 points

These initial tasks help us set up the environment for our application. It is important to research and discuss what framework, programming language, 
and repository we will use before jumping into coding. This will mitigate all the potential risks that we might encounter later.
